- ### Project Overview

The AdventureWorks Power BI Report delivers interactive insights into sales, revenue, profit, and customer behavior across regions and products. It enables data-driven decisions through trend analysis, profitability tracking, and customer segmentation. Built with Power BI, DAX, and SQL, the report identifies high-performing products, monitors KPIs, and highlights areas for growth and optimization, helping business leaders improve strategy, efficiency, and profitability. 

This project combines data cleaning, analysis, and visualization to deliver an intuitive and interactive experience for stakeholders. As a data analyst, this project served as a hands-on opportunity to apply my skills and knowledge in a real-world setting.
